Codewars Kata. Connect Four

Thought it would be fun to implement the VM part of this game
as an educational exercise since I'm new to MVVM.
I would have wanted to write unit tests for HasWinner, 
but I can't unit test a method called from a static method
without mocking/DI, and I'm not going into that at this juncture.
Code review would be REALLY appreciated.
